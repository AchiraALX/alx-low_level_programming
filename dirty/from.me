You know I want you, it is not a secret I try to hide
	I am like freaking right now because 

i didm't suppose this to be happening

Actually no one says what we get to be....

We will be together for always
	 
	 I can still see your love for me in your eyes

Am keeping you forever and for always

	Wake up in every morning to your sweet face

In 			your arms
