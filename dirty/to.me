YOU KNOW I WANT YOU, IT IS NOT A SECRET I TRY TO HIDE
	I AM LIKE FREAKING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE 

I DIDM'T SUPPOSE THIS TO BE HAPPENING

ACTUALLY NO ONE SAYS WHAT WE GET TO BE....

WE WILL BE TOGETHER FOR ALWAYS
	 
	 I CAN STILL SEE YOUR LOVE FOR ME IN YOUR EYES

AM KEEPING YOU FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS

	WAKE UP IN EVERY MORNING TO YOUR SWEET FACE

IN 			YOUR ARMS
