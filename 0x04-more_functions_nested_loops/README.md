This is the alx's 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops project.

<p>1. First task is to chect if a given character or array of a char probably is upper or lower, In this case I will use the ASCII reference to check. (>= 65 && <= (65 + 26) or either use the char if (>= 'A' && <= 'Z') it will return 1 and any other letter it will retun 0. </p>
